ASSIGNMENT 1 - Adam Heller

	#35 - Consider the following pseudocode.

		repeat
		  i = 1
		  read a value for x
		  if ((x < 5.0) and (2x < 10.7)) or (sqrt(5x) > 5.1) then
		    write the value of x
		  end if
		  increase i by 1
		until i > 5

	      The input values for x are 1.0, 5.1, 2.4, 7.2, and 5.3. What are the output values?

		ANS: 1.0, 2.4, 7.2, 5.3

	

	#37 - Rewrite the following statement form with a simplified conditional expression, where the function
	      odd(n) returns true if n is odd.

		 if not((Value 1 < Value 2) or odd(Number))
		 or (not(Value1 < Value 2) and odd(Number)) then
		   statement1
		 else
		   statement2
    		 end if

		 ANS: if (Value 1 >= Value 2) and odd(Number) then
		        statement1
		      else
		        statement2
		      end if
	      



	#38 - You want your program to exectute statement 1 when A is false, B is false, and C is true, and to
              execute statement 2 otherwise. You wrote
		
		if not(A and B) and C then
                  statement 1
		else
		  statement 2
		end if

	      Does this do what you want?

		ANS: No.



	
	#61 - Percival is a truth teller. Llewellyn is a liar. Percival cannot be the liar, because then he
              would be contradicting himself. Therefore he is telling the truth, and Llewellyn must be the liar.

	#62 - Whether Merlin is a liar or a truthteller depends on whether Meredith is a liar or a truthteller.

	#63 - Rothwold is a truthteller and so is Grymlin. If Rothwold were a liar, he'd actually be a truthteller,
              which is a contradiction. And since he is not a liar, neither is Grymlin, according to his statement.

	#64 - Gwendolin's statement is a paradox. If she were a liar, she would actually be a truthteller, and vice versa. 
              Merrilane's condition is unknown.
